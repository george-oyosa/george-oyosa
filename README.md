__Programming is fun, Python is fun__

👋 I am George M. Oyosa (_@george-oyosa_) and a full-time Python enthusiast💞️. I find pleasure in programming and currently learning Data Science🌱, Networking🌱 and Big Data Analytics🌱.  
I am looking to collaborate on any programming projects in **Python**, **C**, **C++** and Web Development especially using the **Django Web Framework** for backends and **Django REST Framework** for APIs.  
Reach me through: 📫 _george.oyosa@gmail.com_ or via my site at: 🔗 _www.patlys.co.ke_ and let's work something out.
